## First impressions

AirPods Pro are an exceptional pair of wireless earbuds that provide a premium audio experience. The first thing that you'll notice when you take them out of the box is their sleek, compact design. They are incredibly lightweight and fit comfortably in your ears, thanks to their customizable ear tips that come in three different sizes.

## Design

The design of Apple AirPods Pro is sleek and modern, featuring a rounded and compact shape that is instantly recognizable as a product of Apple. The earbuds are small and lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The stems are also shorter and more streamlined than the original AirPods, giving them a more modern look.

The earbuds themselves are made of a white glossy plastic that is smooth to the touch, and the charging case has a similar design, with rounded edges and a compact size that makes it easy to carry around. The charging case also features a small LED light on the front that displays the current charging status of the AirPods, making it easy to see when they are fully charged and ready to use.

One of the most innovative design features of the AirPods Pro is the inclusion of silicone ear tips that come in three different sizes, ensuring a perfect fit for any ear size. The ear tips are designed to create a comfortable and secure seal that blocks out outside noise, allowing for a more immersive listening experience. The ear tips are also easy to remove and replace, making it simple to switch between different sizes or replace them when they become worn.

## Audio quality

AirPods Pro are highly regarded for their music quality, and it's no surprise given their advanced features and powerful technology.

First and foremost, the AirPods Pro utilize an active noise cancellation system, which helps to reduce external noise that can often interfere with music quality. This feature helps to provide a much clearer sound, which in turn allows users to hear even the smallest details in their music. With the active noise cancellation turned on, users can enjoy their music even in very noisy environments, without any external interference.

In addition to noise cancellation, the AirPods Pro are equipped with a custom high dynamic range amplifier. This helps to provide rich, deep bass, while still preserving the clarity of the midrange and high-frequency sounds. The soundstage is also wider and more open, which creates a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience. The amplifier ensures that every note is heard with accuracy, providing a crisp and clear sound.

The AirPods Pro also support a feature called "Adaptive EQ", which automatically adjusts the sound to match the shape of a user's ear. This means that the sound is optimized for each individual user, which in turn improves the quality of the music. By tailoring the sound to each user, the AirPods Pro provide a more personalized experience that is unique to the listener.

Furthermore, the AirPods Pro are also designed with a spatial audio feature, which simulates surround sound. This feature works by utilizing advanced algorithms that take into account the direction and movement of a user's head. It can create a highly immersive soundstage, with sound seeming to come from all around the listener. Spatial audio is a perfect fit for watching movies or TV shows, as it can help to create a more immersive experience, and it also enhances the quality of music.

The AirPods Pro are also equipped with two microphones in each earbud. These microphones help to reduce wind noise, which can often be a significant problem when using headphones outdoors. The microphones also help with voice calls and audio recording, providing clear and high-quality audio that is free from any external noise or interference.

## Ease-of use

The AirPods Pro are also incredibly easy to use. They automatically connect to your device when you take them out of the charging case, and pause the audio when you take them out of your ears.

The controls are intuitive, with touch sensors on the stems of the earbuds for adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and activating Siri. You can also switch between noise cancellation and transparency modes with a simple tap. The AirPods Pro also feature a "force sensor" that lets you easily control playback and calls with a long press. In addition, the earbuds are sweat and water-resistant, which makes them ideal for working out or other activities. Overall, the AirPods Pro are very user-friendly and convenient to use in various situations.

## Living with Airpods day to day

When wearing the AirPods Pro in noisy situations, the noise cancelling feature is particularly effective, making them a great choice for commuting, travel, or working in a loud environment. The noise cancelling technology is able to block out a wide range of frequencies, so you can focus on your audio without being distracted by outside noise. Additionally, the Transparency mode is useful when you need to hear ambient noise, such as announcements or traffic, without removing your earbuds. However, it's worth noting that the ear tips may cause some discomfort or pressure for some users, particularly after extended use.

## Battery life

AirPods Pro are wireless earbuds that offer a host of features, including noise cancellation, transparency mode, and automatic pausing when the earbuds are removed from the ear. But one of the most critical aspects of any pair of wireless earbuds is battery life, and the AirPods Pro deliver in that regard as well.

According to Apple, the AirPods Pro can provide up to five hours of listening time and up to three and a half hours of talk time on a single charge. With the included wireless charging case, users can enjoy over 24 hours of listening time and over 18 hours of talk time. Additionally, a quick 5-minute charge can provide up to an hour of listening time or up to an hour of talk time.

In my experience, the AirPods Pro deliver on their battery life promises. I use them regularly for both listening to music and making phone calls, and I find that they can last for several hours without needing to be charged. The charging case is also very convenient, and I often find that I can go several days without needing to recharge the case itself.

One of the best features of the AirPods Pro in terms of battery life is the automatic pausing when they are removed from the ear. This means that the earbuds are not constantly draining their battery when they are not in use, which helps to extend their battery life overall. When the earbuds are returned to the ear, they automatically resume playing, making it easy to pick up where you left off.

Another helpful aspect of the AirPods Pro's battery life is the ability to check the battery status using your iPhone or other Apple device. When you open the AirPods Pro case near your iPhone, a pop-up window will display the battery percentage for both the earbuds and the case. This makes it easy to monitor the battery life and plan accordingly for when you might need to charge them.

Overall, I find the battery life of the AirPods Pro to be good. While they may not be the longest-lasting wireless earbuds on the market, they deliver solid performance and are more than sufficient for most users' needs. The automatic pausing when removed from the ear is a particularly helpful feature, as it helps to conserve battery life when the earbuds are not in use. And with the included charging case, users can enjoy a full day's worth of listening time without needing to recharge the earbuds themselves.

## Conclusion

Overall, AirPods Pro are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. They offer fantastic audio quality, active noise cancellation, and a user-friendly design that makes them a joy to use. They may be a bit pricey, but they are well worth the investment if you value audio quality, comfort, and convenience.

Compared to other wireless earphones, AirPods Pro offer a unique combination of features, design, and sound quality. Many users report that the AirPods Pro offer superior noise cancellation and sound quality compared to other wireless earbuds on the market. Additionally, the earbuds fit snugly in the ear, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods.

One area where the AirPods Pro fall short compared to other wireless earphones is battery life. While the earbuds themselves offer up to 4.5 hours of listening time, the case only provides an additional 24 hours of battery life. This falls short of other wireless earphones on the market, some of which offer more than 10 hours of battery life on a single charge.

Another advantage of the AirPods Pro over other wireless earphones is their integration with Apple devices. When used with an iPhone, for example, the AirPods Pro offer a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily control playback, access Siri, and switch between devices. However, this level of integration is limited for users of non-Apple devices, as many of the advanced features are not available or may require additional steps to set up.

Overall, AirPods Pro offer a unique combination of features, design, and sound quality that make them stand out in the crowded market for wireless earphones. While they may not offer the longest battery life or the most advanced features for non-Apple users, their tight integration with Apple devices and superior noise cancellation and sound quality make them a popular choice for many users.
