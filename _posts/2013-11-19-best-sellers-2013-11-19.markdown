> "Diamond is an amazing book! It's about a little girl called Ellen-Jane, and Ellen-Jane tries to earn money by walking on her hands and like a crab. But then her father sells her to a circus man and the man changes her name to Diamond... You may think that 'Hetty Feather' hasn't come, as the book says 'from the life of Hetty Feather'. Don't worry, she does come along! Diamond is such a good book, I could not even put it down." -
