Amazon are currently offering free delivery on some orders over here in Ireland, where the streets barely have a name.

### Super Saver Delivery

This is the name Amazon gives to their free shipping option. To take advantage of this offer, you need to have about â‚¬30 of stuff being bought at the same time.

So here's how to get the free shipping. Round up your mates or dig out the Christmas gift list, and add all the items you need over at [Amazon Ireland](http://www.shopireland.ie). You should see a message like this in your basket if you don't have enough to get the free shipping:

### Send to Amazon

Next, press the "Send to Amazon" button, and continue through the usual checkout. Look out for this choice though:

You'll want to select the "FREE Super Saver Delivery" option as shown by the arrow.

### Sit back and wait

Your order might take a day or two longer to get here, but it's well worth the wait. Get your orders in soon before Amazon stops this offer.
