Every year as the days grow shorter and the nights colder, we look forward to a tradition in which we all get together of an evening, virtually or in person, to watch the one and only [Late Late Toy Show](https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/late-late-toy-show/).

This year, 2020's Toy Show was pericularly special. Constrained by the ongoing restrictions around *you know what* Ryan Tubridy and his crew managed to put together a truly wonderful show filled with songs, chats with amazing kids and of course loads of cool toys.

## Toy Show Appeal

Among all the amazing moments the biggest one was the launch of the [RTÉ Toy Show Appeal](https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/late-late-toy-show/). During the show the appeal managed to raise an amazing €5.2 million to support a range of charities all around Ireland.

## Rule The World 

A highlight of the show was the amazing [Rule The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxCnl4bbDoc) song that featured Gary Barlow on piano and included greetings from Irish families all over the world.

## Fantastic Mr Fox and the Twits

The theme of the show was [Roald Dahl](https://www.shopireland.ie/home/search/roald+dahl/). From the introduction and throughout the show there were costumes of all sorts of characters from his books. The show also features loads of other great books, as well as toys, so let's take a look at what was featured!

## Featured toys

## Toys

The toys featured in the 2020 RTÉ Late Late Toy Show!

Thw show opened with a hoovering competition featuring this [Henry Vacuum Cleaner](https://www.shopireland.ie/toys/B07TZRXSM1/). It wasn't plugged in on the show, but it's an actual working replica!

We also saw some [Dyson handheld vacuums](https://www.shopireland.ie/home/search/dyson+handheld/) featured, but they weren't nearly as charming in my opinion.
