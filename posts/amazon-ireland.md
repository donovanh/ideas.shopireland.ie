Why is there no [Amazon Ireland](https://shopireland.ie)? What are the best ways for people [shop online in Ireland](https://shopireland.ie)? Are there ways to limit what Amazon.co.uk shows so that we can be sure the items can be shipped over to Ireland?

These are some of the questions we at [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie) hear often. In this post we will explore some of these and hopefully provide some useful tips and ideas.

## What is Amazon's history in Ireland?

[Amazon.co.uk](https://amazon.co.uk) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, a multinational e-commerce company based in the United States. It was first launched in the UK in October 1998, offering customers a wide range of products, including books, electronics, clothing, and more. While Amazon.co.uk primarily serves customers in the United Kingdom, it has also become a popular destination for online shopping in Ireland.

In the early years, Amazon.co.uk faced some logistical challenges in serving the Irish market, as shipping and delivery times were slower and more expensive than they are today. However, as the company grew and expanded its global network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, it was able to offer faster and more affordable shipping to Irish customers.

Over the years, Amazon.co.uk has continued to expand its offerings and services in Ireland. In 2006, the company launched its Amazon Prime subscription service, which provides free and fast shipping, streaming of movies and TV shows, and other benefits to members. In 2013, Amazon opened a customer service center in Cork, Ireland, creating hundreds of new jobs in the region.

Today, Amazon.co.uk is a popular destination for online shopping in Ireland, with a wide range of products, competitive prices, and fast and reliable shipping options. The company has also expanded its presence in Ireland through its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud-based infrastructure and services to businesses of all sizes.

## Why is there no Amazon Ireland?

While Amazon operates in Ireland, there is currently no actual Amazon.ie website. If you are looking for [Amazon in Ireland](https://shopireland.ie), you can use Shop Ireland.

The reason for this is that Ireland is a relatively small market compared to other countries where Amazon operates, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

Instead of creating a separate website for Ireland, Amazon has chosen to serve Irish customers through its main website, Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. This allows Irish customers to access a much wider range of products and services, including international shipping options, while still benefiting from the convenience of shopping online with Amazon.

Additionally, Ireland is a member of the European Union, which means that Amazon is required to comply with EU regulations and laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means that Amazon must take steps to ensure the protection of user data and privacy for all customers, including those in Ireland.

While there is no Amazon.ie website at the moment, it is possible that Amazon may consider launching a dedicated [Amazon in Ireland](https://shopireland.ie) website in the future if the market demand and business needs justify it.

## What are the best ways for people [shop online in Ireland](https://shopireland.ie)?

There are many ways for people to shop online in Ireland, depending on their preferences and needs. Here are some of the most popular options:

1. Shop Ireland: [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie)is an Irish website that shows Amazon's prices in Euro. Since the purchases are handled by Amazon.co.uk (or Amazon.de), Irish customers can browse and purchase products from a wide range of categories, with fast and reliable shipping options available.

2. Irish online retailers: There are many online retailers based in Ireland that offer a wide variety of products and services, including fashion, electronics, groceries, and more. Some popular Irish online retailers include Littlewoods Ireland, Argos Ireland, and Harvey Norman.

3. International online retailers: Many international retailers offer shipping to Ireland, allowing customers to purchase products that may not be available locally. Some popular international online retailers include ASOS, Zara, and H&M.

4. Online marketplaces: Online marketplaces like eBay and Etsy allow users to buy and sell products from a wide range of sellers. This can be a good option for finding unique or hard-to-find items, but it's important to be cautious and read seller reviews and ratings before making a purchase.

5. Grocery delivery services: Several grocery stores in Ireland, such as Tesco and SuperValu, offer online shopping and home delivery services for groceries and household essentials. This can be a convenient option for busy shoppers who want to avoid crowded stores or save time on errands.

## Why do people use [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie)?

People use [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie) to search for products that are available for purchase in Ireland. [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie) is a search engine that searches the Amazon.co.uk product database and returns results for products that can be shipped to Ireland.

While Amazon.co.uk is a popular destination for online shopping in Ireland, not all of the products available on the website can be shipped to Ireland. [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie) helps customers in Ireland find products that can be shipped to their address, making it easier to find and purchase the products they want.

ShopIreland.ie is also useful for customers who want to compare prices for products from different sellers on Amazon.co.uk. The search engine allows users to filter results by price, category, and other factors, making it easier to find the best deal for the product they want.

Overall, people use [Shop Ireland](https://shopireland.ie) to save time and find the products they want, while also ensuring that the products can be shipped to their address in Ireland.

## How up-to-date are the prices on Shop Ireland?

We update the prices every 24 hours, along with updating the Pound to Euro conversion rate daily. The prices come straight from Amazon and other than being converted to Euro (including Irish VAT where appropriate), are not otherwise changed in any way. 

## Are my purchases guaranteed?

Since all purchases are handled by Amazon, the same Amazon guarantee applies. You can log in to Amazon to see your order history, download invoices, deal with returns and more.

## Is my payment information safe?

Again, since all purchases are handled by Amazon, the payments only happen within Amazon. Shop Ireland does not access your payment information at any stage, so it's as safe as shopping directly on Amazon.
